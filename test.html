            Hello! My name is Albert Holskog and I am a first year Front End
            Development student at Noroff University College in Kristiansand. I
            used to work as a sailor, but I wanted to challenge myself and learn
            something new. I have always enjoyed working with coding and solving
            problems.

            This was a topic assignment during my first year. Gamehub is a
            website where you can buy different games, both new and second hand.
            You can also sell your old games. I have designed and coded this

            This was an exam paper during my first year. This is a website for a
            museum called the community science museum. On the page you will
            find information about the museum and its program. You can also sign
            up for tours and support the museum by getting involved. I have
            designed and coded this website.
